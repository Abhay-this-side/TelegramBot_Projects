# ResPro Bot 👨‍💻

## Inspiration 💡
As an undergraduate students who have less time to scroll over the internet, I have provided a one-stop solution to their project findings

## What it does 💪
It provides the project based on the **language** the user wants and gives them a **pdf file** of the project based on that language
- /start: starts the bot
* /language: enter the language in the format /language python
  
## How we built it 🛠
Created a bot from telegram **BotFather** and used the **bot token** and connected telegram and python using different libraries. I created a Telegram bot using python-telegram-bot and telethon libraries and deployed it on MySQL workbench using my-sql-connector. Set up my database using SQL to store the different languages(for instance only 9 languages are supported by the bot)

## Challenges I ran into 🧗‍
- Gathering information for my database
- Testing of the bot and different libraries used in this problem
- Lots and lots of sleep-deprived debugging

## Accomplishments🎖
- Completed our project in less than 24hrs considering my inexperience with bots
- Developing a rather smooth flow for users
- Made free for anyone from anywhere

## What we learned 🙇 
- How to work with different APIs (python-telegram-bot, mysql-connector, filters, upgrades)
- Queries in SQL
- Deployment of a telegram bot
- Cleanliness of a code

## What's next for RamsiiBot! 🔮
- We are looking to further populate our database with greater breadth and depth, be it through any open-source datasets, APIs, or user feedback
- Increasing customizability like research papers, minor projects etc.
- Moving to a cloud database on Google Cloud Platform which could make updates more convenient

### Step-by-step : 
1. Set up MySQL Database.
2. Install the necessary extensions for Python development in VS Code. Install python-telegram-bot library using pip. Use the MySQL connector for Python to connect to the MySQL database and retrieve website links based on user input.
3. Create a Telegram Bot. Open Telegram search for "BotFather" and start a chat.
4. Create a Python script, e.g., telegram_bot.py, and write the code to interact with the Telegram API and MySQL database.
